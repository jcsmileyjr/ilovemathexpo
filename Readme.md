### Purpose:
A math practice app for a child

### Motivation:
I was inspired by my daughter who wanted to help her little brother learn math with a app. She described how she wanted it to look and the functionality. 

### Objectives:
* The user is given the choice of practicing addition, subtraction, division, or multiplication.
* The user will be given 10 problems with the numbers being 1-10. 
* The user is constantly reminded of the number of questions remaining and the score.

### This app was built with the following technologies:
**React Nataive:** JavaScript mobile app framework 
 
**Git-Hub:** Web-based version control repository and Internet hosting service
 
**Flexbox:** A CSS based layout technology for building responsive websites
  
**JavaScript:** Object-oriented programming language for web pages
 
**HTML:** Mark-up language for creating web pages 
 
**CSS:** A formatting language for styling web pages
